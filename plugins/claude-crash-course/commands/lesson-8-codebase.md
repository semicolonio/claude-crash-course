# Lesson 8: Decode Any Codebase in Minutes

Jump into unfamiliar code and understand it fast - no matter how complex.

---

## Step 1: The Codebase Challenge

Ever opened a new project and felt lost?

**I can help you:**
- Understand project structure
- Find where features are implemented
- Trace code execution paths
- Explain complex functions
- Map dependencies

**All through conversation.**

**Ready to explore?** Say "yes"!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 2: Pick a Codebase

**Option A:** Use your own project (tell me the directory)

**Option B:** Clone a small open-source repo to explore

**Option C:** Explore this course plugin itself!

What do you want to explore?

*Wait for user choice, then continue...*

---

## Step 3: Get the Overview

Let's start broad.

**Ask me:**
"Explain the structure of this codebase"

I'll analyze the files and give you an overview!

*Wait for user to ask, then use Glob/Read to analyze structure, then continue...*

---

## Step 4: Find a Feature

Now let's get specific.

**Ask me:**
"Where is [feature name] implemented?"

Pick any feature from the codebase!

*Wait for user to ask, then use Grep/Read to find it, then continue...*

---

## Step 5: Explain the Code

Found it? Let's understand it.

**Ask me:**
"Explain how this function works" (reference the file)

*Wait for user to ask, then read and explain the code, then continue...*

---

## Step 6: Trace Execution

Let's follow the code flow.

**Ask me:**
"Trace the execution path when [action] happens"

*Wait for user to ask, then trace through files, then continue...*

---

## Step 7: Find Dependencies

What does this code depend on?

**Ask me:**
"What are the main dependencies of this project?"

*Wait for user to ask, then analyze package.json/requirements.txt/etc, then continue...*

---

## Step 8: Real-World Use Cases

**Onboarding:**
- New job? Understand the codebase fast
- Contributing to open source? Learn the structure

**Debugging:**
- "Where is this error coming from?"
- "What calls this function?"

**Learning:**
- "How did they implement X?"
- "What patterns are they using?"

**Which applies to you?** Share!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

## Step 9: Codebase Exploration Tips

✅ **Start broad** - Structure first, details later
✅ **Ask specific questions** - "Where is login handled?"
✅ **Use @** - Reference specific files
✅ **Follow the flow** - Trace execution paths

❌ **Try to read everything** - Ask targeted questions
❌ **Get lost in details** - Start with the big picture

**Make sense?** Say "understood"!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

## Step 10: Codebase Navigator = You

Excellent! You now know:

✅ **Project structure** - Understand organization
✅ **Find features** - Locate implementations
✅ **Explain code** - Understand complex functions
✅ **Trace execution** - Follow code paths
✅ **Fast onboarding** - No more days of confusion

**This skill alone is worth its weight in gold.**

**Next up:** Debug code like a pro!
