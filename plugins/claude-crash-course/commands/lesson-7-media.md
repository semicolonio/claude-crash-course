# Lesson 7: Process Media Like a Pro

I can help you edit videos, compress files, convert formats - all through conversation.

---

## Step 1: FFmpeg Basics

**FFmpeg** is a powerful media processing tool. I can use it for you.

**What we can do:**
- Trim and cut videos
- Compress files
- Convert formats (MP4, WebM, GIF, etc.)
- Extract audio
- Create thumbnails
- Process batches

**First, let's check if FFmpeg is installed.**

**Ask me:** "Check if FFmpeg is installed"

*Wait for user to ask, then run `ffmpeg -version` or install it if needed, then continue...*

---

## Step 2: Get a Sample Video

For this lesson, you'll need a video file.

**Option A:** If you have a video file, tell me the path

**Option B:** Ask me to download a sample video for testing

What works for you?

*Wait for user response, handle accordingly, then continue...*

---

## Step 3: Analyze the Video

Let's see what we're working with.

**Ask me:**
"Show me the details of this video file"

*Wait for user to ask, then use ffmpeg/ffprobe to show video info, then continue...*

---

## Step 4: Compress It

Videos can be large. Let's compress it.

**Ask me:**
"Compress this video to reduce file size"

*Wait for user to ask, then use ffmpeg to compress, then continue...*

---

## Step 5: Use Subagents for Long Processes

Notice: Media processing can take time.

**For complex tasks, I can use subagents** - specialized helpers that run in the background while we continue chatting.

This is useful for:
- Long video encodes
- Batch processing
- Multiple operations

**Make sense?** Say "yes" or ask questions!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 6: Extract Audio

Let's pull the audio from your video.

**Ask me:**
"Extract the audio from this video as MP3"

*Wait for user to ask, then use ffmpeg to extract audio, then continue...*

---

## Step 7: Create a GIF

This is popular - turn video clips into GIFs.

**Ask me:**
"Convert the first 5 seconds of this video to a GIF"

*Wait for user to ask, then create GIF, then continue...*

---

## Step 8: More Media Use Cases

Here's what else you can do:

**Content Creation:**
- "Trim this video from 0:30 to 1:45"
- "Add a watermark to this video"

**Optimization:**
- "Convert this to web-optimized MP4"
- "Resize this video to 720p"

**Batch Operations:**
- "Compress all MP4 files in this folder"
- "Convert all MOV files to MP4"

**Want to try one?** Pick any!

*Wait for user to try one, help them through it, then continue...*

---

## Step 9: Best Practices

✅ **Backup originals** - Always keep source files
✅ **Test settings** - Try on one file first
✅ **Use subagents** - For long processes
✅ **Be specific** - Tell me exact times, formats, quality

❌ **Process huge batches** - Start small
❌ **Expect instant results** - Video encoding takes time

**Got it?** Say "understood"!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

## Step 10: Media Processing = Mastered

Excellent! You now know:

✅ **FFmpeg basics** - Install and use it
✅ **Compress videos** - Reduce file sizes
✅ **Format conversion** - MP4, GIF, MP3, etc.
✅ **Extract audio** - Pull audio tracks
✅ **Subagents** - Handle long processes

**No more googling ffmpeg commands!**

**Next up:** Understand any codebase quickly!

*Pro tip: Combine operations! "Compress this video, trim it to 30 seconds, and convert to MP4" - I'll chain the commands!*
