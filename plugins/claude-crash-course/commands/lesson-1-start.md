# Welcome to Claude Code Crash Course!

You're about to learn how to code with an AI partner. This isn't like other AI tools - let me show you why.

---

## Step 1: Let's Get to Know Each Other

Hey! I'm Claude. I live in your terminal and can help you code.

**Quick question** - ever used AI coding tools before?

A) Yes, like Copilot or Cursor
B) Nope, first time
C) Tried a bit

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 2: What Makes Me Different?

Cool! Here's the thing about most AI coding tools - they autocomplete your code as you type. That's helpful, but limited.

**I'm different.** I can:
- Read your entire codebase
- Edit multiple files at once
- Run commands in your terminal
- Debug errors
- Explain complex code
- Build entire features

Think of me as a coding partner, not just autocomplete.

**Sound interesting?** Just say "yes" or "let's go" when you're ready to see it in action!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 3: Let Me Show You Something Cool

Let's do a quick demo. Don't worry, this won't mess anything up.

**Ask me to do this:**
"Show me what files are in this directory"

Go ahead, type it in your own words!

*Wait for user to ask, then use Bash tool to run `ls -la`, show results, then continue...*

---

## Step 4: Did You Notice?

See what just happened?

You talked to me in **plain English**, and I:
1. Understood what you wanted
2. Ran the actual terminal command
3. Showed you the results

No need to remember command syntax. Just tell me what you want.

**Here's my question:** What would make this course valuable for you?

A) Learn to build projects faster
B) Understand code better
C) Debug issues easier
D) All of the above

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 5: What You'll Learn

Perfect! In this crash course, you'll learn to:

**Create & Edit Files** - Build files by just describing what you want

**Work with Code** - Read, understand, and modify existing projects

**Automate Tasks** - Let me handle repetitive work

**Debug Problems** - Find and fix issues faster

**Build Projects** - Create real applications through conversation

Each lesson is hands-on. You'll actually DO things, not just read about them.

**Ready to create your first file?** Type "ready" or "let's do it"!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 6: Your First Creation

Okay, here's your first real task. I want you to ask me to create a file.

**Tell me to:**
"Create a file called welcome.txt that says 'I'm learning Claude Code!'"

Use your own words. Just describe what you want!

*Wait for user to ask, then use Write tool to create the file, then continue...*

---

## Step 7: About That Permission Pop-up

Did you notice I asked for permission before creating the file?

That's a **safety feature**. I always ask before:
- Creating or editing files
- Running terminal commands
- Making changes to your system

**Pro tip:** Press `Shift+Tab` while I'm asking for permission - you can enable automatic approval for specific tools (like file creation) so you don't have to click every time.

**Want to see it?** Ask me to show you what's in welcome.txt!

*Wait for user to ask, then use Read tool to show contents, then continue...*

---

## Step 8: More About Permissions & Commands

Here's the important part about security:

**Running Commands:** I can run terminal commands (like `npm install`, `git status`, etc.). For security, each command requires separate approval. This protects you from accidentally running dangerous commands.

**Want to skip all permissions?** You can start Claude Code with:
```
--dangerously-skip-permissions
```

But I **don't recommend it** - the permission checks are there to protect your system!

**Got it?** Just say "understood" or "ok" to continue!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 9: Let's Make It More Interesting

Now let's edit that file.

**Ask me to:**
"Change welcome.txt to include today's date and make it more exciting"

Be creative with how you ask!

*Wait for user to ask, then use Edit tool to modify the file with date and enthusiastic message, then continue...*

---

## Step 10: The Power Pattern

Notice the pattern?

1. **You describe** what you want in natural language
2. **I understand** and figure out how to do it
3. **I execute** using the right tools
4. **You review** the results

That's the core of working with me. Simple, right?

**Quick check:** Does this make sense so far? (Just say yes/no/ask questions)

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 11: What's Next?

Awesome! You've learned the basics:
- How to talk to me naturally
- How I create and edit files
- The simple pattern we'll use

**In the next lessons**, you'll:
- Build real HTML/CSS/JavaScript projects
- Work with data and APIs
- Explore and understand codebases
- Debug actual problems
- Create automation scripts

Each lesson builds on the last. Take breaks when you need them.

*Pro tip: You can ask me questions anytime during the course. Just ask naturally - "How does this work?" or "Can you explain that?" I'm here to help!*
