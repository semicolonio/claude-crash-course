# Lesson 2: Files

Great job! Now let's work with files.

## Reading Files

Claude Code can read any file in your project. You can simply ask:
- "Show me the contents of hello.txt"
- "Read the package.json file"
- "What's in the README?"

## Editing Files

Claude Code can also modify existing files. Try this exercise:

**Exercise 1:** Ask me to edit your `hello.txt` file and change the message to "Hello from Lesson 2!"

## Creating New Files

You already created a file in Lesson 1, but let's do something more interesting.

**Exercise 2:** Ask me to create a new file called `about.md` with the following content:
- A heading "About Me"
- Your name
- A sentence about why you're learning Claude Code

## Understanding File Operations

When you ask Claude Code to modify files, it will:
1. Show you what it's going to do
2. Ask for your approval
3. Make the changes
4. Confirm the changes were made

Try it now! Complete both exercises above.

## What You Learned

- Reading files with natural language
- Editing existing files
- Creating structured content (like markdown)
- Claude Code always asks before making changes

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've completed the basic course. You now know how to:
- Have conversations with Claude Code
- Create and edit files
- Work with your codebase

**To continue learning:**
- Experiment with your own projects
- Try asking Claude Code to explain code
- Use it for real tasks like debugging or refactoring
