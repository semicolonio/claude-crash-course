# Lesson 2: Real Power - Editing Files

Now for the cool part. I can edit any file in your project.

## Challenge 1: Edit a File

Ask me to:
> "Change hello.txt to say 'I just edited a file with AI!'"

Try it. Use your own words.

## Challenge 2: Build Something Real

Let's create a simple to-do list app. Ask me to:
> "Create a file called todo.html with a simple to-do list page"

I'll build you a working HTML page. Then open it in your browser!

---

## You Did It!

You just:
- Created files with AI
- Edited existing files
- Built a real mini-project

**What's next?** Try Claude Code on your real projects:
- "Explain this code to me"
- "Add error handling to this function"
- "Create a README for my project"
- "Help me debug this issue"

Just talk naturally. I'm here to help.
