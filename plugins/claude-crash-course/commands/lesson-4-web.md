# Lesson 4: I Can Read the Web

Here's a superpower - I can fetch and read any public webpage, then do something useful with it.

---

## Step 1: WebFetch Capability

I can access the internet and read web pages for you.

**Common use cases:**
- Summarize long articles
- Extract specific data
- Write social media posts from content
- Research and compile information
- Get the latest docs or tutorials

**No need to copy-paste.** Just give me a URL!

**Ready to try?** Say "yes" or "ready"!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 2: Pick an Article

Let's practice. Here are your options:

**Option A:** Give me a URL to any article or blog post you want summarized

**Option B:** Use this sample: https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet

Just share the URL!

*Wait for user to provide URL, then continue...*

---

## Step 3: Fetch and Summarize

Great! Now ask me to summarize it.

**Just say:**
"Summarize this article: [URL]"

Or use your own words!

*Wait for user to ask, then use WebFetch to get the content and summarize it, then continue...*

---

## Step 4: What Just Happened?

See what I did?

1. **Fetched the webpage** - Downloaded the content
2. **Processed it** - Converted HTML to readable text
3. **Analyzed it** - Read and understood the content
4. **Summarized it** - Gave you the key points

**All in seconds!**

**Make sense?** Just say "yes" or ask questions!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 5: Let's Get Creative

Now let's turn that article into social media content.

**Ask me:**
"Write a tweet thread (3-4 tweets) from this article"

Try it!

*Wait for user to ask, then create the tweet thread, then continue...*

---

## Step 6: Save It

Nice! Now let's save that content.

**Ask me:**
"Save the tweet thread to a file called tweets.md"

*Wait for user to ask, then save to file, then continue...*

---

## Step 7: More Use Cases

Here's what else you can do:

**Research:**
- "Compare these two articles: [URL1] [URL2]"
- "Extract all the key statistics from [URL]"

**Content Creation:**
- "Turn this article into a LinkedIn post"
- "Create a newsletter section from [URL]"

**Learning:**
- "Explain this tutorial in simpler terms: [URL]"
- "What are the main takeaways from [URL]?"

**Pick one** and try it with a URL of your choice!

*Wait for user to try one, help them through it, then continue...*

---

## Step 8: Best Practices

Here's what works best:

✅ **Public URLs** - I can access any public webpage
✅ **Be specific** - Tell me exactly what you want from the page
✅ **Multiple URLs** - I can compare or combine content
✅ **Fresh data** - I get the current version of the page

❌ **Paywalled content** - Can't access subscription sites
❌ **Login-required** - Can't access private content

**Got it?** Just say "understood" or ask questions!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 9: Practical Workflow

Let me show you a real workflow:

**Scenario:** You need to write a blog post about a trending topic

1. Find 3-4 relevant articles
2. Ask me to summarize each one
3. Ask me to identify common themes
4. Ask me to write an outline
5. Ask me to draft the blog post
6. Done!

**Powerful, right?** Want to try it? (Say "yes" or "skip")

*Wait for user response. If yes, guide them through mini version. If skip, continue...*

## Step 10: Web Content = Your Research Assistant

Excellent! You now know:

✅ **WebFetch** - I can read any public webpage
✅ **Summarization** - Get key points fast
✅ **Content transformation** - Article → tweets/posts
✅ **Research** - Compare and analyze sources
✅ **Save results** - Store content for later

**This saves hours of manual reading and copy-pasting.**
