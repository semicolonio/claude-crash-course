# Lesson 11: Custom Workflows with Slash Commands

Create your own `/shipit`, `/test`, `/deploy` commands - reusable workflows triggered with a slash.

---

## Step 1: What Are Slash Commands?

**Slash commands** = saved prompts you trigger with `/`

Examples:
- `/shipit` - Commit, push, create PR
- `/review` - Code review
- `/test` - Run tests and analyze
- **Your custom workflows!**

**Ready to create one?** Say "yes"!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 2: Create Your First Command

Let's make `/shipit` - commit + push + PR.

**Ask me:** "Create a slash command called shipit that commits, pushes, and creates a PR"

*Wait for user to ask, create the command file in .claude/commands/, then continue...*

---

## Step 3: Try It

**Type:** `/shipit` (or ask me to explain how to use it)

*Wait for user to try or ask, then continue...*

---

## Step 4: Plugins

**Plugins** extend Claude Code with multiple commands.

Check the marketplace: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins

**Want to explore plugins?** Say "yes" or "skip"!

*Wait for user response, guide through plugin installation if yes, then continue...*
