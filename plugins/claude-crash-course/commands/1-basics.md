# Lesson 1: Basics

Welcome! Let's learn the basics.

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an AI assistant that lives in your terminal and helps you with coding tasks. You can ask questions, edit files, run commands, and more - all through natural conversation.

## Your First Exercise: Create a Hello World File

Let's start simple. I'll help you create your first file using Claude Code.

**Exercise:** Create a file called `hello.txt` in your working directory with the content "Hello from Claude Code!"

### Steps:
1. Ask me to create the file (try: "Create a file called hello.txt with Hello from Claude Code")
2. After I create it, verify it exists by asking me to list files
3. Ask me to read it back to confirm the content

**Important:** Don't just run `/2-files` yet. Actually do the exercise above first! Practice conversation.
