# Lesson 12: MCP - Supercharge Claude Code

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - Connect Claude Code to databases, APIs, and external tools.

---

## Step 1: What Is MCP?

**MCP** lets me connect to:
- Databases (Postgres, MySQL, etc.)
- APIs (GitHub, Slack, custom APIs)
- File systems
- External tools
- **Anything with an MCP server!**

Learn more: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp

**Interested?** Say "yes"!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 2: MCP Use Cases

**Development:**
- Query your database directly
- Interact with GitHub API
- Access cloud services

**Productivity:**
- Connect to Notion
- Integrate with Slack
- Access company APIs

**Custom:**
- Build your own MCP servers
- Connect proprietary systems

**Which sounds useful?** Share your thoughts!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 3: Example - GitHub MCP

Let's connect to GitHub (conceptual).

**With GitHub MCP, you could:**
- "Show me open issues"
- "Create a new issue"
- "List recent PRs"

All through conversation with me!

**Want to try setting up an MCP?** (Say "yes" or "skip" - setup can be complex)

*Wait for user response, guide through basic MCP setup if yes, or continue...*

---

## Step 4: Learn More

MCP is powerful but advanced.

**Resources:**
- MCP docs: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp
- MCP server examples
- Community integrations

**Ask me:** "Where can I find MCP servers to install?"

*Wait for user to ask, provide info, then continue...*
