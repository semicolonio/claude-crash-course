# Lesson 9: Debug Faster Than Ever

Find bugs, understand errors, and fix issues through conversation. Let's turn debugging from frustration into speed.

---

## Step 1: The Debug Challenge

**I analyze:**
- Error messages and stack traces
- Runtime behavior
- Logic bugs
- Performance issues

Then **I help you fix them** - fast.

**Ready to debug?** Say "yes"!

*Wait for user response, then continue...*

---

## Step 2: Create a Buggy Program

Let's start with a simple bug.

**Ask me:** "Create a buggy calculator.js with an error in the divide function"

*Wait for user to ask, create file with bug, then continue...*

---

## Step 3: Run It

**Ask me:** "Run calculator.js and show the error"

*Wait for user to ask, run and show error, then continue...*

---

## Step 4: Analyze & Fix

**Ask me:** "Fix the bug you found"

*Wait for user to ask, explain and fix, then continue...*

---

## Step 5: Real Debugging

**Try with your own code!** Paste an error or describe a bug.

*Wait for user, help debug, then continue (or skip)...*
